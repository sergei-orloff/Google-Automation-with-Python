ðŸš€ **Guidelines for Writing Commit Messages in Git** ðŸš€

Effective commit messages are essential for maintaining a clean, collaborative, and comprehensible codebase. A well-crafted commit message ensures that developers can easily understand the history of changes, track bugs, and manage releases effectively. Here are some key guidelines to follow when writing Git commit messages:

### Why a Good Commit Message Matters:
- **Clarity**: Helps developers understand the purpose and impact of changes without diving into the code.
- **Collaboration**: Supports team members in identifying whatâ€™s been changed and why.
- **Debugging**: Provides a reference point when identifying when bugs were introduced or fixed.
- **Automation**: Can integrate with tools that automatically generate changelogs, release notes, or trigger CI/CD pipelines.

### Structure of a Good Commit Message:
A well-written commit message is usually divided into two parts:
1. **Summary (First Line)**:
   - Short and concise, **50 characters or less**.
   - Written in **imperative tense**: "Add feature" (not "Added" or "Adding").
   - Capitalized and free of trailing punctuation.

2. **Detailed Description (Optional)**:
   - Provide more context when needed.
   - Kept under **72 characters per line**, with hard wraps.
   - Should explain **why** the change was made, reference **related issues or bugs**, and include links to more info if applicable.
   - Leave a blank line between the summary and description.

### Example of a Good Commit Message:
```
Refactor login function for improved readability

This refactor simplifies the login function by breaking it into smaller, more manageable parts. 
No logic was altered, but variables were renamed to clarify intent. 
Also added error handling for edge cases.

Fixes #102, resolves security warning in issue #98.
```

### Key Takeaways:
- **Use the Imperative Mood**: It makes commit logs consistent and easier to scan.
- **Keep It Short and Descriptive**: Commit summaries should be clear and direct.
- **Provide Additional Context**: When needed, explain *why* you made the change, not just *what* you changed.

Effective commit messages ensure that your project remains understandable and maintainable for your team, now and 
in the future. Letâ€™s commit to better commit messages! ðŸ’»âœ¨
